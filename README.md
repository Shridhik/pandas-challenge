manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data


Analysis:

Based on our results on bottom performing schools by % of overall passing, we should focus on our district schools: Rodriguez High School,Figueroa High School, Huang High School	, Hernandez High School, and Johnson High School. Surprisingly, the per student budget on average is lower for the better performing charter schools. One observation made in the highest performing schools is that the total student count is low. A suggestion would be to decrease class/school sizes to give students more focused attention as that may be the issue with the bottom performing schools as they have ~2000 more students compared to the top perfroming charter schools. In Sumary, some main takeaways are that Charter schools with less students, and less spending per student are performing better.
